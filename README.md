# SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS_3
This portfolio project investigates sarcasm detection in sentiment analysis. It explores various techniques, including data exploration, text preprocessing, deep learning models (LSTM, CNN, Transformer), and potentially topic modeling with LDA.

1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing (LSTM, CNN with Tensorflow + LDA (topic modelling) + transformer-based model (1).py)

This script focuses on setting up the environment and data exploration.

Data Directory Exploration:

It utilizes os.walk to explore the user's specified directory, printing the full path of each file. This helps identify relevant data files.
Library Imports:

The script imports a comprehensive set of libraries for data manipulation, text processing, visualization, and deep learning:
tensorflow for building deep learning models (LSTM, CNN, Transformer).
pandas for data analysis (potentially for loading data from CSV files).
json for handling JSON data (if applicable).
Text processing libraries:
string and re for text cleaning with string manipulation and regular expressions.
nltk for tokenization, stop word removal, stemming/lemmatization.
spacy for advanced NLP tasks (named entity recognition, dependency parsing).
numpy for numerical operations.
sklearn.model_selection for splitting data into training and testing sets.
Visualization libraries:
matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn for creating various plots and data exploration visualizations.
wordcloud for creating word clouds to visualize word frequencies (potentially for exploring sarcasm-related words).
2. Additional Scripts (to be explored based on availability)

The provided code snippet only shows part 1. You might encounter other scripts in the project that handle specific tasks:

Data Loading and Cleaning: Scripts might load data from CSV or other formats, perform cleaning steps like removing irrelevant information, handling missing values, and potentially applying normalization or standardization techniques.
Text Preprocessing: Code might tokenize text into words, remove stop words (common words that don't contribute much meaning), and apply stemming or lemmatization (reducing words to their base form) for better model performance.
Feature Engineering: Scripts could create new features from existing text data, such as word n-grams (sequences of n words), part-of-speech (POS) tagging, or sentiment lexicons.
Model Building: Deep learning models like LSTMs, CNNs, or Transformers might be implemented using TensorFlow to classify text data as sarcastic or non-sarcastic.
Topic Modeling (LDA): If applicable, scripts could explore topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify underlying themes in the text data that might be related to sarcasm.
Evaluation: Code might evaluate the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Scripts could create visualizations to understand model performance, data distribution, or relationships between different variables.

Future Work

This project provides a foundation for sarcasm detection using various techniques. Here are some potential areas for further exploration:

Experiment with different deep learning model architectures (LSTM, CNN, Transformer) and hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
Investigate the effectiveness of topic modeling (LDA) in identifying sarcasm-related topics in the data.
Explore incorporating sentiment lexicons or other domain-specific knowledge to enhance model accuracy.
Visualize the attention mechanisms within Transformer models to understand which parts of the text the model focuses on for sarcasm detection.
Deploy the trained model as a web application or API for real-time sarcasm detection in social media or other text data sources.
By building upon this initial exploration and incorporating these potential improvements, you can develop a robust and effective system for sarcasm detection.
